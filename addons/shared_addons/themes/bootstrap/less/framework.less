/*
 * ---------------------------------
 * EIM LESS FRAMEWORK
 * This is how we do it (for now)
 * ---------------------------------
 * @author Adam Kelsven 
 *
 * NOTES:
 * All less files used in the framework are loaded here. If you want to NOT include something,
 * just comment it out in this file or in bootstrap/bootstrap.less which handles loading all 
 * bootstrap related assets.
 *
 * - Global variables are loaded first so they are usable in ALL less files
 * - Helpers/mixins are loaded next
 * - Structure is loaded to handle any of the layout settings (ie. width:420px; padding:20px; )
 * - Styles compliment the structure and will have things more related "fluff" (ie. color:#ff0; )
 * - Custom is the 'catch-all'. Imagine a place where you can put all of your page dwiddlies.
 *
 *    Example:
 *    
 *    .widget.that-one { width:300px; background-image:url(butt.png); padding:12px; };
 *
 * This compiles down to framework.css. From there, the only css file that is reference in the
 * template is website.css because it loads any external font references and framework.css (ala Scott Trsar).
 *
 * Nested elements are used in instances where it makes sense instead of duplicating selectors over and over.
 *
 * WARNING:
 * Any styling done in any css file will be overwritten the next time LESS is compiled. 
 * So, do ALL styling in .less files.
